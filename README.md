## :book: What I learned

Handle errors manually with fetch calls

```
const data = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${input}`)
const user = await data.json()
if (user.message) {
setError(true)
return
}
setUser(user)
```

### :house: Development

- Add animations
- Have the correct color scheme chosen for users based on their computer preferences(prefers-color-scheme).
